# NuggetAcas

## What is it?
The Nugget ACAS (Automated crew alerting system) is a system for visually displaying
faults and possible fixes. Inspired by the ECAM found in Airbus aircraft. It uses a 
mysql (or mariadb) database to store fault conditions and fault codes. It is based off
of the asciimatics python package.

## Sounds good how do I run it?

Uhhh haven't gotten here yet. I'm sure you can work it out. Instructions coming soon.

### Can I use it in my program
As per the GPLV3 liscense you are allowed to use this with your project or program
unless it is closed source. If for some reasons you want to use my code in a closed sourced
program feel free to contact me.
