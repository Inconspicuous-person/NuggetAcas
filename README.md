# NuggetAcas

## What is it?
The Nugget ACAS (Automated crew alerting system) is a system for visually displaying
faults and possible fixes. Inspired by the ECAM found in Airbus aircraft. It uses a 
mysql (or mariadb) database to store fault conditions and fault codes. It is based off
of the asciimatics python package.

## Sounds good how do I run it?

Uhhh haven't gotten here yet. I'm sure you can work it out. Instructions coming soon.
